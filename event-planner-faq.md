# Event Planner FAQ

* Confirm your event was budgeted for. Current budget can be found [here](./useful-links). **DO NOT** go over budget or reallocate budget without talking to the GA^3 Treasurer ([ga3-treasurer@mit.edu](mailto:ga3-treasurer@mit.edu)) first.
* **DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS** on behalf of MIT. Your signature does not represent the Institute and all liability will fall on the unathorized singatory.
* If you are planning to have single reimbursement for **$1,000 or more**, or have **more than 100 attendees**, talk to the GA^3 Treasurer ([ga3-treasurer@mit.edu](mailto:ga3-treasurer@mit.edu)) first.
* If your event is using money from GSC, check [here](./register-event) to see if you need to register your event.
