# Event Planner FAQ

* Confirm your event was budgeted for. Current budget can be found [here](./useful-links). **DO NOT** go over budget or reallocate budget without talking to the GA^3 Treasurer first.
* DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS on behalf of MIT. Your signature does not represent the Institute and all liability will fall on the unathorized singatory.
* If you are planning to have single reimbursement for $1,000 or more, talk to the GA^3 Treasurer first.
* If your event is using money from GSC, check [here](./register-event) to register your event.
