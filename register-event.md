# Registering an Event

## Does your event need to be registered?
* If your event will be funded in any part by GSC and will have >100 attendees, your event **MUST** be registered **BEFORE** the event. Failure to do so will cause reimbursement delays.
* Events with fewer <=100 attendees no longer need to be registered.
* [Full list of criteria](https://engage.mit.edu/SOLE/survey?survey_uid=89b624fd-e025-11eb-92ca-0ed0b84bd193)

## Where do I register?
* All events meeting the above criteria must be registered on [Atlas](https://atlas.mit.edu/).

## Travel?
* If your event is GSC funded and will involve travel outside the immediate Cambridge area (e.g. camping trip), the event **MUST** also be registered as travel within Engage.
    * Under Engage go to "Survey & Forms" and search for "Travel"
    * Fill out the "Domestic Travel Form"
