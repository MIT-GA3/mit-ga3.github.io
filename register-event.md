# Registering an Event

## Does your event need to be registered?
* If your event will be funded in any part by GSC, your event **MUST** be registered **BEFORE** the event. Failure to do so will cause reimbursement delays.

## Where do I register?
* If your event will have <100 attendees, you register in [Engage](https://engage.mit.edu/)
    * The event must be registered using the link on the Egage home page, not a club page
* If your event will have >=100 attendees, you must register on [Atlas](https://atlas.mit.edu/)

## Travel?
* If your event will involve travel outside the immediate Cambridge area (e.g. camping trip), the event **MUST** also be registered as travel within Engage.
    * Under Engage go to "Survey & Forms" and search for "Travel"
    * Fill out the "Domestic Travel Form"
