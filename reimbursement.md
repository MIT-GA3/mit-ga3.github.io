# Reimbursement Instructions


## Step 1: Purchasing for an Event
* Receipts must be itemized, timestamped, and show proof of payment
* We cannot reimburse sales tax
    * You can get the tax removed by presenting [MITâ€™s tax exempt forms](https://vpf.mit.edu/mits-state-sales-tax-exemptions) to the merchant
* We cannot reimburse alcohol
* Do not use the same receipts for multiple RFPs
* Your reimbursement will be directly deposited into the bank account you have on record with MIT (i.e. the same account you receive your bi-weekly graduate stipend).
    * If you are not paid by MIT (i.e. a visiting student) you will instead receive a check in the mail
* If you the event planner and using GSC funds, check if your event needs to be registered in Engage ([instructions here](./register-event)).
