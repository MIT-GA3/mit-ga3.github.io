# Reimbursement Instructions

## Step 0: Event Planning
* If you're planning the event, check the [Event Planner Checklist](./event-planner-checklist) before continuing.


## Step 1: Purchasing for an Event
* Receipts must be itemized, timestamped, and show proof of payment.
    * "Proof of payment" means the receipt states the items have been paid for by either cash/credit/debit (as opposed to a bill which just says how much is owed).
* We cannot reimburse sales tax.
    * You can get the tax removed by presenting all three of [MIT's tax exempt forms](https://vpf.mit.edu/mits-state-sales-tax-exemptions) to the merchant.
* We cannot reimburse alcohol.
* If tipping is appropriate, make sure you follow [OVC Tipping Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbeyoK0fzLqHrLwqSlt6x83UE1Ga2ncS/view?usp=sharing). You will not be reimbursed for tips that exceed these guidelines.
* Do not use the same receipts for multiple RFPs.
* Your reimbursement will be directly deposited into the bank account you have on record with MIT (i.e. the same account you receive your bi-weekly graduate stipend).
    * If you are not paid by MIT (i.e. a visiting student) you will instead receive a check in the mail.
* If you are the event planner and using GSC funds, check if your event needs to be registered in Atlas ([instructions here](./register-event)).
